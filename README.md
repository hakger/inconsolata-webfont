* **Description**
Inconsolata is a monospace font, designed for code listings and the like,
in print. There are a great many "programmer fonts," designed primarily for use
on the screen, but in most cases do not have the attention to detail for high
resolution rendering. Inconsolata draws from many inspirations and sources.
First and foremost, Inconsolata is a humanist sans design, striving for clarity
and cleanlines.

The family comprises two weights: regular and bold

The Inconsolata font family is released under the SIL Open Font License,
